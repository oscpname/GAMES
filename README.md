different tests and simulations

TESTs tests and flags
---------------------------
* Detect shellcode that loads DLL with socket API after process creation
* Penetration framework or shellcode was detected
* Changed protection type of library in a remote process space
* Indirect command was executed
* The executable has section names not typically seen in standard compilers
* The executable uses APIs related to debugging, which could indicate anti-debugging or self-analysis. (LoadLibrary)
* File can delay its execution (Sleep)
* File can create a reverse shell. (include <winsock2.h>)
* File can retrieve thread local storage values (Thread)
* File can allocate memory (VirtualAlloc)
* File can create processes on Windows (CreateProcess, OpenProcess)
* File can write\read to files on Windows (fopen)
* File can write to a pipe for inter-process communication (CreateNamedPipe)
* This binary was packed with UPX

Obfuscation flow

tools: 
SuperNova [git](https://github.com/nickvourd/Supernova)

manual steps (creating polimorph + asm + random)
* compile exe
* cut bin with Infaltive Loader
* place shellcode into asm loader\runner
* The Assembly Code Scrambler - Polymorphic prep part 1 - asmobfuscator.py: python asm_obfuscator.py input.asm
* compile this using nasm to get our .obj file: nasm -fwin64 locate_kernel32_mod.asm
* extract the shellcode from the compiled assembly .obj file using python helper
* encode it to add more layers of polymorphism to our code - Bitwise NOT (python) key will be in the encoded shellcode itself! - We need to note positions so to use on the next phase in the decoder
* place into asm x64 decoder: Just pick one of the index locations the script discovered as your decoding key and apply it to our .asm file below
* Part III - Adding in the Alphanumeric / mix Component to our Shellcode. go ahead and copy and paste that shellcode somewhere
* Place into C runner or whatever place
* test on ANYRUN
