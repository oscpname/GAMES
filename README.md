different tests and simulations

TESTs tests and flags
---------------------------
* Detect shellcode that loads DLL with socket API after process creation
* Penetration framework or shellcode was detected
* Changed protection type of library in a remote process space
* Indirect command was executed
* The executable has section names not typically seen in standard compilers
* The executable uses APIs related to debugging, which could indicate anti-debugging or self-analysis. (LoadLibrary)
* File can delay its execution (Sleep)
* File can create a reverse shell. (include <winsock2.h>)
* File can retrieve thread local storage values (Thread)
* File can allocate memory (VirtualAlloc)
* File can create processes on Windows (CreateProcess, OpenProcess)
* File can write\read to files on Windows (fopen)
* File can write to a pipe for inter-process communication (CreateNamedPipe)
* This binary was packed with UPX

|1| NTLM_LPE_CVE-2025-33073| not working| to repeat with bettercap? new printerbug?|
|2| LNK_CVE-2025-50154| working, but hangs| repeat with smbserver with user\password?|
|3| DLL loading with powerchell| SUPER| hide console, make upload command|
|4| ICMP_SHELL| SUPER| binary is suspicios, improve OPSEC|

|8| Asmloader| ??| -|
|9| Asm loader + polymorph + KrbrelayUp| ? will it trigger binary?| -|

Obfuscation flow
---------------------------
* compile exe
* SuperNova?
* cut bin with Infaltive Loader
* compile final exe with Polaris-Obfuscator?
* Polymorh in asm
* asmloader to run final shellcode
